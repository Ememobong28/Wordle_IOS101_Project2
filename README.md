# Project 2 - *Wordle 2*

Submitted by: **Immanuella Emem Umoren**

**Name of your app** Wordle is an app with six chances to guess a 5-letter word. It will show you if the letter is included in the word. Flag green is a letter contained; if it is in the correct position, flag yellow is the letter included but in the wrong position. But now you can edit a number of guesses; you can change the number of letters of words, change the theme of the game to animals, country, and normal, reset the game, and increase difficulty with "alien wordle."

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total
